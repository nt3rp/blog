[Last we left our less-than-intrepid writer]({filename}/2013-07-08-getting-better-all-the-time.md),
he had made contact with the great and powerful publisher. The publisher was
well-prepared, with arcane scrolls in hand, quill at the ready to lay out the
contract, set out the terms, and begin a profitable venture for both parties.
The outline completed and the ink dry on the contract, our writer parted ways
along the path to success and fortune.

... Or something like that.

What can I say about the rest of the process of writing a technical book? As I
write this, it has been almost three months, but I'll do my best to piece the
process together.

## "I'm just talkin' 'bout practice"
After the contract was done, which layed out the production schedule, the ball
was in my court, so to speak. In that sense, producing the drafts is relatively
straightforward: get draft X done by date Y.

Getting started writing a book is, admitedly, difficult. Though I have a number
of technical books around (including some cookbook-style books), that doesn't
mean I just want to copy other people's style. Given that this was my first
book, I didn't even know if style was a thing.

The first few drafts were the worst, as I didn't have any idea what it should
sound like, or how long it would take to get a draft done. I imagine this is
true of typical writing, but its a bit compounded by the fact that you also
have to include code samples both in the chapter and for distribution with the
book.

Even after getting a few chapters done, I didn't really get into the swing of
writing the book until I was nearly done. By that I mean, I missed deadlines a
lot; usually, not by much, but I missed almost every deadline. The important
part, in this case, and as part of the whole process, is communication: Let the
publisher know what is going on in your life that might delay things, and when
you expect to be able to provide what you've committed to. I was fortunate in
that my publisher was very understanding, but I imagine others may not be.

How badly off the mark was I for deadlines? Well, for the drafts...

| Chapter | Deadline   | Delivered | Late |
|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|:----:|
| 1       | 2013-08-13 | 2013-08-15|  +2d |
| 2       | 2013-08-27 | 2013-08-26|  -1d |
| 3       | 2013-09-09 | 2013-09-10|  +1d |
| 4       | 2013-09-22 | 2013-09-24|  +2d |
| 5       | 2013-10-04 | 2013-10-09|  +5d |
| 6       | 2013-10-18 | 2013-10-20|  +2d |
| 7       | 2013-10-31 | 2013-11-02|  +2d |
| 8       | 2013-11-12 | 2013-11-13|  +1d |
| 9       | 2013-11-26 | 2013-11-26|  +0d |
| 10      | 2013-12-10 | 2013-12-09|  -1d |
| 11      | 2013-12-24 | 2013-12-30|  +6d |
| 12      | 2014-01-07 | 2014-01-14|  +7d |

On average, that's ~2.15 days per deadline. Just a little bit late. Because
each missed deadline really only penalized myself, the production schedule was
only off by the last deadline, so it was pushed back by a week.

That lateness is a result of inexperience, I think. I underestimated the amount
of work it took do write a chapter initially, which means on at least two
ocassions I actually took a day off of work to meet my deadline (or let it slip
less). As I dug into the meatier chapters, I also learned that some o the
recipes I set out to do were much harder than anticipated, leading me to either
greatly revise the scope of the recipe, or drop it entirely.

## The Final Stretch

After the drafts were wrapped up, things got pretty easy. A number of editors
and reviewers would go through the various chapters, and include comments and
suggestions for the book. Most of which made sense (e.g. some were bugs) and
many made the book better. A lot of them were stylistic changes, and by that I
mean enforcing of the book styles. I'll bring that up separately...

As I was saying, drafts take up a lot less time after you understand what to
expect. The first few set of edits resulted in me writing the chapters to meet
a certain style of writing consistent with other Packt books. Of course, after
that, I just applied what I learned when I was writing the other chapters.

I should mention that edits would come in periodically while I was writing
chapters, so their developement was often interspersed with book writing.

Eventually, with the edits and drafts done... that was it. I was sent
pre-finals, which are PDF copies of what would go to print with some very minor
revisions, and then... the book was published. Hooray!

# More numbers and thoughts

How long did this take anyway? Looking at my records, this is what I've got.

| Chapter | Writing | Edits | Total |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 1       |  13.00h | 2.50h | 15.50h|
| 2       |  11.25h | 3.83h | 15.08h|
| 3       |  12.00h | 2.25h | 14.25h|
| 4       |   6.50h | 2.25h |  8.75h|
| 5       |   9.00h | 2.75h | 11.75h|
| 6       |   6.00h | 1.50h |  8.50h|
| 7       |  11.00h | 3.50h | 14.50h|
| 8       |  13.66h | 7.25h | 20.91h|
| 9       |   8.50h | 4.25h | 12.75h|
| 10      |   5.25h | 1.50h |  6.75h|
| 11      |   8.50h | 2.25h | 10.75h|
| 12      |  13.50h | 1.75h | 15.25h|
| Other   |   5.00h | -     |  5.00h|

For a grand (approximate) total of 159.74 hours. If the minimum wage is $11 per
hour (In Ontario), that would be... $1757.14. Given that I was paid $3000 USD
as an advance (and for the moment, we'll ignore the exchange rate), that *actually*
works out to about $18.78 an hour. Of course, as I said, the hours are likely
underestimated, but that's not terrible.

What did I learn from this?

- **I hate using LibreOffice / OpenOffice / MS Word for editing**. Since we all
used different applications, the styles were messed up every time a different
reviewer received the drafts. As well, markup is super finicky. I don't know
LaTeX, but I much would have rather used that, or Markdown, or anything over MS
Word / etc.

- **I would definitely do this again**. Maybe not with the same publisher, but
I know that I am capable of writing a book (as I think anyone is). If I did it
again, I would self-publish, which would give me more freedom as to how I
write. Packt wasn't very restrictive, but my initial chapters were more
conversational, and I think I like being able to write in that style, but its
hard to say. However...

- **Getting a publisher means you get paid, etc**. I didn't do any marketing
for my book. None. Bupkis. Despite this, I still got an advance ($3000 USD)
paid out partially in regular intervals as defined in the contract. I'm not
saying that I'm incapable of marketing my own book, but getting that advance
was immensely helpful.

- **Writing a book is really helpful**. Sure, you learn a lot about writing,
and working on your own, and you can say you wrote a book, but it really helped
me when applying for work. I could say "Oh, and I wrote this book". People see
that as a big achievement (even though it really isn't that hard to do) and it
gives you a story to talk about in interviews. I was really surprised how big
of an impact my book was in interviews.

So [I wrote a book](http://www.packtpub.com/highcharts-cookbook/book). Hooray!
