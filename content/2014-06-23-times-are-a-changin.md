I have not been the best at updating my blog.

... or updating my twitter, for that matter.

It has been a rough year. I don't want to blog about blogging, or make things
too personal, but I feel like some explanation is in order. I'll keep it brief:

- [As I mentioned]({filename}/2013-06-30-writing-a-technical-book-first-contact.md),
I started writing a book. That book [is now finished](), and I should write
about what that experience was like. That covers from July to March.

- Things at [Willet](http://willetinc.com) did not turn out as I had expected.
The company still exists; I just decided that it was time to move on. On the
plus side, I have a [new job](http://triggit.com), and I learned a lot about
running a business, managing a team, and looking for work (some data included).
I'll try to write more on that as well, but that process took from March to May,
eating up a lot of time.

- I switched from [Octopress](http://octopress.org) (Ruby) to
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com) (Python). Why? Familiarity, mostly, and
as a technical person I have a tendency to play around with different
libraries. Because I was focussing on the tools (and not the content), I got a
little... distracted. That in combination with the above made it difficult for
me to update. I am not going to lie, I will probably try something different
again.

- I went to [Anime North](http://animenorth.com) again, without much help
from [HotelTracker](https://github.com/nt3rp/HotelTracker) (though, after making
some significant changes to it as well). I might write about that... we'll see.

- I started to look for a house. Not hugely impactful, but something that
happened. I don't plan on writing about mortgages or real estate agents so
*don't* expect to hear about that.

Suffice to say, its been very busy, but I'm hoping to change that.

Let's see if I can get back into the swing of things!
